# Learning Log

Learning Log is a web app that allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page describes the site and invites users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
